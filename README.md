## üí° Concept

I've filtered out all currencies with it's value compared to ‚Ç¨1,- and separated them via continents for my previous assignment for [Functional Programming](https://github.com/dannyfrelink/Functional-programming). This time I needed to create some form of visualisation from the data I've gathered.

I started with the intention of creating an unique kind of visualisation, but it was more difficult than I anticipated. Because of the different kind of dataset I was using for my visualisation, it was hard to find a way to use D3 on my work. Eventually I settled for a simple bar chart with the option to change the chart for six continents.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process (Wiki)

You can find all the progression of my work documented in my [Wiki](https://github.com/dannyfrelink/frontendData/wiki).

## üìù Wishlist

As described in [Concept][https://github.com/dannyfrelink/frontendData#concept], I was planning on experimenting with different types of charts. Sadly, because of some difficulties, I wasn't able to try a lot of things and had to settle for a bar chart. These are things I wish I'd had more time for to try and make something to really be proud of.

You then need to install http-server globally to host a server:
```
npm install -g http-server
